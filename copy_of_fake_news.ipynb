But he still would suffer from problems that have afflicted Tillerson, chief among them a boss who has shown little regard for diplomacy and no qualms about undermining his secretary of state with tweets, current and former U.S. officials said. News media reports, first published by the New York Times, that Trump has a plan to replace his embattled secretary of state with Pompeo, a former U.S. congressman who now heads the Central Intelligence Agency, drew mixed reviews from serving U.S. officials. Some argued that things at the State Department can hardly get worse than they have been under Tillerson, whose 10-month reign has been marked by an exodus of top diplomats, deep dismay at planned 30 percent budget cuts, and conflicts with Trump. \\u201cAnybody could play the hand he\\u2019s been dealt better than Tillerson,\\u201d said one U.S. official on condition of anonymity, saying things can only get better. But others argued that any new secretary of state would face the same obstacles as Tillerson, who was undercut this year when Trump told his chief diplomat to stop \\u201cwasting his time\\u201d trying to negotiate with North Korea. \\u201cThis is a hellish environment for a secretary of state,\\u201d said one State Department official on condition of anonymity. It was not clear whether Trump plans to throw Tillerson, who in October reportedly called the president a \\u201cmoron,\\u201d overboard. Tillerson has not directly addressed whether he made the comment, though his spokeswoman denied it. Asked on Thursday if he wanted Tillerson to stay, Trump sidestepped the question saying: \\u201cHe\\u2019s here. Rex is here.\\u201d \\u201cThere are no personnel announcements at this time,\\u201d White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders later said in a statement that left Tillerson twisting in the wind. Trump was alienated by the reported \\u201cmoron\\u201d comment and Tillerson positions that differ from Trump\\u2019s on North Korea and the Gulf standoff between Qatar and Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations, said another senior official. Tillerson has embittered many in the State Department by embracing the planned budget cut, failing to get top officials into key diplomatic jobs, relying on a handful of aides and keeping his distance from career diplomats. If Trump went with Pompeo, he would tap a former Army armor officer and Harvard Law School graduate who was in his fourth term representing a Kansas district in Congress when he was chosen to lead the CIA, where officials say he has enjoyed a less hostile relationship with career spies than Tillerson has had with career diplomats. While some intelligence officers say Pompeo tends to tell the president what he wants to hear rather than giving him their assessments, others say they have been impressed by his intellect, his willingness to listen and his advocacy of more robust covert operations.  Current and former officials said Pompeo was likely to get along better with Congress and with the White House, not least because of his conservative bent. However, they said Pompeo would need to resist the planned budget cuts and find a way to grapple with Trump\\u2019s tweets. \\u201cIf the president undercuts what he is trying to achieve diplomatically, convinces people that whatever you agree to with the secretary of state will be overturned by the president ... then he is basically neutered,\\u201d said Richard Boucher, a former top U.S. diplomat who now teaches at Brown University. \\u201cSo the question is not whether Pompeo can do the job but whether the president is going to let Pompeo do the job.\\u201d \",\n          \" (In this Dec. 8 story, corrects Peters\\u2019 affiliation in paragraph 12 to reflect company name change) By Jonathan Spicer and Rob Cox NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve Bank of New York will soon narrow its search for candidates to fill what is considered the Fed\\u2019s second-most powerful job after having scouted a diverse field, from a local business school dean to a former Fed governor. New York Fed President William Dudley steps down in mid-2018 and people in contact with the directors leading the search for his successor say they have so far considered several economists, academics, investors, bankers and policymakers. \\u201cThey are looking beyond the traditional mold\\u201d of an expert in banking, markets or monetary policy, and plan to start trimming a preliminary list of candidates in coming days, said one person in contact with the directors.  The New York Fed president is at the intersection of U.S. monetary policy and financial markets, and is responsible for the policing of Wall Street and the diplomacy with central bank counterparts around the world.  Unlike other top roles with a permanent vote on policy, the New York Fed boss is nominated by the regional bank\\u2019s board of directors rather than the White House and does not require Congressional approval. Dudley\\u2019s successor could play an even greater role guiding the Fed through a historic leadership change in which U.S. President Donald Trump can fill six of the seven seats on the Fed Board of Governors. He has so far named Jerome Powell and Randal Quarles - lawyers, not PhD economists - to top positions in Washington, with Powell replacing Chair Janet Yellen who unlike her predecessors will only serve one term. Both men support the Republican push for Wall Street deregulation. Yet their relatively limited experience with monetary policy compared with their predecessors has raised questions over the Fed\\u2019s tightening plans and how it might tackle any severe economic downturn.  By now the New York Fed directors have kept open what an ideal candidate profile should look like, according to people familiar with the search. Two of those people, who declined to be named given the sensitivity of the process, said search firms have contacted among several others Peter Blair Henry, 48, dean of New York University\\u2019s Stern School of Business, and former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.  Warsh, 47, who was in the running for Fed Chair before Trump picked Powell last month, declined to be considered for the New York job, they said. One of these people said Henry appeared to be the early front-runner.  Henry and a spokeswoman for Warsh at Stanford University\\u2019s Hoover Institution, where he is a visiting fellow, did not respond to requests for comment.  The permanent-voting Fed governors need a White House nod and Senate approval. The other 11 district presidents vote every two or three years under a century-old rotation meant to emphasize New York's unique role as a counterbalance to the Washington-based board. Its president enjoys broad independence and also serves as vice chair of the central bank's rate-setting committee. (For a graphic of the Fed's ideological doves and hawks, see: goo.gl/5BpTex) \\u201cIt\\u2019s a critical position and more important than the Fed\\u2019s vice chair from a market standpoint,\\u201d Greg Peters, senior investment officer at PGIM Fixed Income, which oversees $695 billion in assets, told Reuters.  Still, the Fed\\u2019s Board of Governors would need to approve the nominee chosen by New York\\u2019s four-member search committee led by liberal-leaning directors Sara Horowitz and Glenn Hutchins. Horowitz, founder of the Freelancers Union which advocates for independent workers, chairs the New York Fed\\u2019s board. Hutchins is co-founder of private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners and a noted public-policy philanthropist.  Several weeks before Dudley\\u2019s resignation announcement in early November, the two were already hitting the phones and holding meetings to cast a wide net for potential candidates diverse primarily in terms of professional background, but also race and gender, according to those familiar with the effort. The New York Fed declined to comment. In a video posted on its website last month, the search committee said they sought a range of attributes from team-building and sensitivity to local economic trends, to intellectual leadership and crisis management.  The initial search effort suggests the next New York Fed chief could have a different background than Dudley and his predecessors, who tended to be bankers or market economists with Wall Street or U.S. Treasury experience, and who were all white and male.   Dudley was chief economist at Goldman Sachs before joining the Fed where he became a key architect of its crisis response and later the No. 2 policymaker behind Yellen.  At the time of his departure, the New York Fed will have only begun the tricky task of trimming its currently $4.4-trillion portfolio of assets accumulated since the crisis, a task that would favor candidates with market experience.  Jamaica-born Henry, who will step down as Stern\\u2019s dean at year end, would instead bring his expertise in global trade and shore up the number of economists in the Fed\\u2019s upper ranks. A review of Henry\\u2019s public papers and comments reveal little about his views on U.S. monetary policy or financial supervision, though his expertise in capital flows could bolster the New York Fed\\u2019s role as foreign liaison. If chosen he would become the institution\\u2019s first black president. Those who have spoken to New York Fed directors said past and present insiders, as well as outsiders, were considered. Among them were: Simon Potter, the head of the New York Fed\\u2019s markets desk; Brian Sack, his predecessor in that role now at hedge fund D.E. Shaw; and Lorie Logan, Potter\\u2019s deputy.  They said the field also included Lael Brainard, one of four sitting Fed governors; former Fed governor and Harvard professor Jeremy Stein; and Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economic adviser at PIMCO-parent Allianz SE. All of those named declined to comment. It was unclear how much formal contact if any they have had with the New York Fed about the job. The bank has said the process should take six to nine months.       \",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in U.S. House of Representatives began staking out their positions on final tax legislation on Tuesday, days ahead of talks with the Senate to shape the tax package lawmakers hope to send to President Donald Trump by year end. While lawmakers expect a smooth reconciliation of rival House and Senate tax bills, House Republicans have taken issue with several items in the Senate\\u2019s legislation - from a one-year delay in cutting the corporate tax rate to 20 percent to the sunsetting of individual tax cuts after 2025. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said lawmakers are determined to eliminate the alternative minimum taxes (AMTs) on corporations and individuals that the Senate bill retained.  \\u201cHouse members ... feel strongly that the House position should be to repeal permanently both the individual and the corporate,\\u201d said Brady, who is expected to chair the House-Senate negotiations that could begin next week. The corporate and individual AMTs are designed to limit the ability of corporations and wealthy individuals to reduce their payments through tax breaks and credits. But jettisoning them could require tough decisions on how to keep the legislation below a $1.5 trillion ceiling on revenue losses. Republicans must also bridge differences on taxes for corporate and pass-through businesses, top earners, inheritances, individual tax brackets and repeal of the Obamacare individual health insurance mandate. Republicans hope to approve a final bill and deliver it to Trump\\u2019s desk before Christmas. If they succeed, it will be the first major U.S. tax overhaul in 31 years and the first big Republican legislative victory since Trump took office in January.   The House voted to go to conference with the Senate on Monday, and Republicans named nine conference delegates. Senate Republicans could name delegates as early as Wednesday. \\u201cMy hope is that we\\u2019re done with this within 10 days to two weeks,\\u201d said Representative Kristi Noem, a Republican conference delegate and member of Brady\\u2019s committee. House Republicans are also considering a new approach to the deduction for state and local taxes. Both the House and Senate bills eliminate deductions for income and sales taxes but retain one for $10,000 in property taxes.  Republicans from high-tax states, including New York and New Jersey, have been angered by the change. But Brady said Republicans are considering the possibility of giving taxpayers an option to deduct $10,000 in state and local property taxes, income taxes or sales taxes. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"politicsNews\",\n          \"News\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"November 30, 2017 \",\n          \"December 8, 2017 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"class\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The White House responded to say that it doesn t matter if the former reality show star posted fake videos about Muslims because  the threat is real!  Scary, huh? A backlash ensued after Trump retweeted three times from a woman who was convicted of a hate crime in the U.K.The current occupant of the White House is upset because British Prime Minister Theresa May responded to Trump s widely condemned retweets this morning, saying,  It is wrong for the president to have done this.  In a statement, Downing street further said,  Britain First seeks to divide communities by their use of hateful narratives that peddle lies and stoke tensions. They cause anxiety to law-abiding people. Members of British Parliament also condemned Trump s retweets.So naturally, Trump lashed out on Twitter at our ally s leader. The problem is that he tweeted to the wrong Theresa May, a person who only has 6 followers, causing that Twitter user to receive nearly 9,000 notifications.We took a screen capture because we knew (and he did) the Dotard would delete it. Here s Trump s full tweet to the totally wrong person. Finally, Trump tweeted the correct Theresa May, writing the same message:  Don t focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom. We are doing just fine! .@Theresa_May, don t focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom. We are doing just fine!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 30, 2017Wrong! We are not doing  fine  when the so-called leader of the free world tweets to the wrong world leader, even though he is addicted to Twitter and still cannot tweet correctly. And now that he has corrected his tweet, he sounds just as idiotic as he did this morning when he started tweeting out fake videos in order to promote his ban on Muslim countries.What a fuckin  moron.Photo by David Becker/Getty Images\",\n          \"(Reuters) - Twitter Inc faced questions on Friday about its approach to internal security after a company employee briefly deactivated U.S. President Donald Trump\\u2019s account. The 11-minute blackout of the @realDonaldTrump account late on Thursday drew widespread attention to the microblogging site. Trump frequently uses Twitter to announce policy, assail his adversaries and to tangle with countries, including North Korea, over world affairs. Some users voiced fears that future employee interference or technology glitches involving Trump\\u2019s account could threaten national security.  The incident also came as Twitter grapples with overall criticism of its handling of account suspensions, user abuse and ever-changing terms of service.   Twitter said in a tweet on Friday: \\u201cWe have implemented safeguards to prevent this from happening again. We won\\u2019t be able to share all details about our internal investigation or updates to our security measures, but we take this seriously and our teams are on it.\\u201d A company representative declined to answer questions including how many employees can suspend an account or what special protections there are for high-profile users like Trump. Trump was back on Twitter soon after the account was restored, and the employee did not send or alter any tweets.  Cyber security experts had previously speculated Twitter could have installed special protections on Trump\\u2019s account, such as the ability to only access it from certain devices. \\u201cWe have learned that this was done by a Twitter customer-support employee who did this on the employee\\u2019s last day. We are conducting a full internal review,\\u201d Twitter said in a tweet late on Thursday. \\u201cWe are continuing to investigate and are taking steps to prevent this from happening again,\\u201d the company said in an earlier tweet. Reuters could not determine how many Twitter employees had the authority to delete accounts or if any had the ability to tamper with them in other ways, such as by sending bogus tweets.  \\u201cIn all seriousness: We need accountability for social media sites,\\u201d Ken Meyer, who served as digital director for former Vice President Joe Biden, tweeted. \\u201cLone employees shouldn\\u2019t be able to change statements from the President.\\u201d Speaking on condition of anonymity, a former Twitter employee said it was unlikely a worker with suspension privileges would also be able to hijack an account to send out messages.   \\u201cDifferent types of access,\\u201d the former employee said. \\u201cI\\u2019m not sure anyone at Twitter can tweet from someone else\\u2019s account.\\u201d  Another person familiar with Twitter operations, speaking on condition of anonymity, said employees currently cannot post from a user\\u2019s account, change or even view a user\\u2019s password, which is encrypted. Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist at the nonprofit Center for Democracy and Technology, said the suspension reflected a need for Twitter to be more transparent about its ability to control accounts but also demonstrated the perils of a head of state relying on digital technology as a primary mode of communication. \\u201cIt would be nice to rely on older forms of policy communication with solid foundations,\\u201d he said, adding that Twitter should require two-person controls for certain high-profile accounts. The New York Times on Friday reported the rogue employee was in fact a contractor, citing two anonymous sources familiar with the incident.  Twitter and other tech companies have ramped up their reliance on contractors due to pressure to respond more quickly and thoroughly to content violations. While the companies \\u201care desperately reliant upon human nuance and sophistication for decision making, human will is quite a risk,\\u201d Sarah Roberts, a UCLA professor who studies such contractors, said in a tweet. \\u201cAin\\u2019t that a bind?\\u201d The company on Friday separately announced minor updates to its rules, including more clarity on what actions could result in an account suspension. It was the latest in a string of iterative changes amid criticism the platform too slowly and inconsistently responds to abuse. Twitter shares were up 1.9 percent in afternoon trading.  Trump, who has nearly 42 million Twitter followers, responded to the temporary loss of his account by boasting about his wide reach on the service. \\u201cMy Twitter account was taken down for 11 minutes by a rogue employee,\\u201d Trump said on Twitter early on Friday. \\u201cI guess the word must finally be getting out-and having an impact.\\u201d He has used Twitter to attack opponents and promote his policies, both during the 2016 presidential campaign and since taking office in January. Thursday\\u2019s incident also raised questions about how Twitter secures the official @potus presidential account and other accounts that could potentially influence world events. Technology companies including Twitter are, meanwhile, under attack from U.S. lawmakers for failing to stem the spread of Russian propaganda and misinformation on their platforms. Twitter in particular has long been criticized for not doing enough to police its platform and respond to complaints of harassment.  Though the temporary deletion of the Trump account sparked a flood of criticism from Twitter users, many of the president\\u2019s critics also said they were happy to see the account disabled.  In 2013, hackers took control of the main account for the Associated Press and tweeted that explosions at the White House had injured then-President Barack Obama, causing stocks to briefly plunge. \",\n          \"Fox  News  host Sean Hannity spent a whopping 6 seconds covering Tuesday night s election results in which Democrats gained seats across the country in a referendum to Donald Trump and his policies. Hannity, an ardent defender of Trump s, explained the Democratic electoral victories in three of the states by saying,  Those results in Virginia, New Jersey, and New York   not states Donald Trump won.  Hannity devoted 14 words to cover the election results in which Democrats trounced Republicans. In fact, as Shareblue notes,  Democrats flipped 14 seats in the Virginia House of Delegates   the largest Democratic gain in a single election in the state since 1899. Hannity just shrugged it off.Watch:Sean Hannity's election coverage pic.twitter.com/l8DNJbfVRq  John Whitehouse (@existentialfish) November 8, 2017After the hate-march in Charlottesville, Virginia in which tiki-torch carrying bigots terrorized the city while marching in Trump s name, resulting in the death of Heather Heyer, the Commonwealth rejected hate and bigotry at the polls yesterday.Newly elected Virginia state delegate Danica Roem, an openly transgender woman, defeated Bob Marshall, a Republican incumbent who billed himself as the commonwealth s  chief homophobe. Instead of covering the big news, Hannity, a man who can be spotted usually humping on Trump s leg, decided to cover the former reality show star s speech in South Korea and his 2016  victory.

Jason (@berg0887) November 8, 2017That s some real in-depth reporting there, Sean. The Fox News host likes to routinely call liberals  snowflakes  but he s the snowflakiest snowflake on TV.  It s probably better for Hannity that he didn t report the actual news, though. It looks like he was about to cry. Although, drinking Hannity s salty conservative tears is kind of satisfying after Trump stumped so hard for Ed Gillespie s campaign on Twitter.Image via screen capture. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"class\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Things get said that we ll remember forever, whether that s a good thing or a bad thing.When George W. Bush said his FEMA Director  Brownie  was doing a  heck of a job,  Dubya couldn t possibly have known it would become synonymous with ironically praising a dismal performance.When reporters are the first to come across emergent tweets about disastrous, high-profile events, they can look just like vultures:Source: TwitterAnd when  spiritual leaders  publicly blame a tragedy on the ills of the world rather than the actual cause, it can leave a similar stain. Remember when Jerry Falwell blamed pagans, gay people, feminists, and  abortionists  for the attacks on September 11, 2001? Of course you do. It was as disgusting then as it is now.Similarly, the man I consider to be the Worst Human On The Planet  just said that the worst mass shooting in American history happened because people talk shit about Donald Trump. Seriously.Pat Robertson, the host of the Christian Broadcasting Network s 700 Club, went on his show Monday and made the predictably horrific statement: Violence in the streets, ladies and gentlemen. Why is it happening? The fact that we have disrespect for authority; there is profound disrespect for our president, all across this nation they say terrible things about him. It s in the news, it s in other places. There is disrespect now for our national anthem, disrespect for our veterans, disrespect for the institutions of our government, disrespect for the court system. All the way up and down the line, disrespect. That s right: People who wish we had a president who didn t act like a schoolyard bully and NFL players who silently protest the murder of unarmed black people across America are to blame for the events of Sunday night in Las Vegas.I have a different belief, Pat. I believe you are responsible for the legions of  Christians  across this country who don t give enough of a fuck about human life to change anything.Featured image via Mario Tama/Getty Images\",\n          \"Donald Trump has spent a lot of time cozying up to dictators during his time as what we are forced to call  President,  but he just did something that should have every single American outraged: he apologized to Turkish dictator Recep Tayyip Erdo an over an incident earlier this year in which his bodyguards brutally attacked American protesters.Eleven Americans were injured (including a police officer) and nine were hospitalized when Erdo an s security forces charged a group of peaceful protesters outside the Turkish ambassador s residence. We are communicating our concern to the Turkish government in the strongest possible terms,  State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said at the time.Apparently, that translates to:  I m sorry Daddy, please don t be mad at me. Can I still have a pony? Erdo an told PBS NewsHour on Tuesday that Donald Trump called  about a week ago about this issue.  And Trump certainly took a stand against Americans: He said that he was sorry and that he was going to follow up on this issue when we come to the United States within the framework for an official visit. The White House, which regularly lies in press conferences and releases, denies that an apology was made.Last month, a grand jury indicted 19 defendants (including 15 of Erdo an s security guards) for the brutal attack on protesters. The Hill reports:The defendants, 16 of whom were charged in June on criminal complaints, were indicted on a charge of conspiracy to commit a crime of violence. Many of the 19 were also indicted on additional charges including assault with a dangerous weapon and aggravated assault.The charges stem from Turkish President Recep Erdogan s visit to Washington in May to meet President Trump. Guards for Erdogan attacked protesters near the embassy in a brawl that was caught on video.The Turkish Embassy defended the guards at the time, saying they were acting in self-defense and claiming the protesters were aligned with a terrorist group from Turkey.But Washington s police chief said the attack was unprovoked.Two defendants have been arrested, but the rest are currently at large.Was Erdo an lying? Maybe   but at this point, he is more trustworthy than our serial liar-in-chief who regularly shows his disdain for the majority of the people he is supposed to lead.Donald Trump is disgusting, as is anyone who works for him willingly and anyone who voted for him.Featured image via screengrab\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"class\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
